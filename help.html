          </p>

          <h4>Step 6: Enter in your SecureID Username and Token </h4>
          <p>These were issued to you by your IT staff. If you do not have one, you must contact them to obtain one. Please note that your SecureID token is a
          combination of a numeric passcode chosen by you and the rotating numeric sequence generated by your <strong>RSA SecurID</strong> token generator. Click "Sign In" after
          you have entered your credentials. In a few moments, you should be connected to the  VPN. At that time you may close the Junos Pulse client interface
          and use your mobile device as you normally would. You don’t need to do anything special to access the  network once you have connected to the VPN. If
          your VPN session becomes disconnected or times out, you will need to re?authenticate following steps 5 and 6 in this guide.<br>
